# Development Notes

## System Specifications

### Environment
- Node.js
- Express.js
- CoinGecko API v3

### Dependencies
- **express**: Web server framework
- **coingecko-api-v3**: API client for CoinGecko cryptocurrency data

## Implementation Details

### API Client Configuration
The CoinGecko API client is configured with:
- 10 second timeout to prevent long-hanging requests
- Auto-retry functionality for handling rate limit errors

### Endpoints Implementation

#### Initial Implementation

##### 1. Root Endpoint
- Purpose: Health check for server status
- Path: `/`
- Response: JSON message confirming server is running

##### 2. Trending Coins
- Purpose: Retrieve trending cryptocurrency data
- Path: `/api/trending`
- Method: `client.trending()`
- Error Handling: 500 status with error details on failure

##### 3. Price Data
- Purpose: Get price information for specified coins
- Path: `/api/prices/:coinIds`
- Parameters: Comma-separated list of coin IDs
- Method: `client.simplePrice()`
- Options:
  * Currencies: USD, EUR
  * 24h change included

##### 4. Coin Details
- Purpose: Retrieve detailed information about a specific coin
- Path: `/api/coins/:coinId`
- Method: `client.coinId()`
- Error Handling: 500 status with contextual error message

#### Enhanced Implementation

The API has been enhanced to support all major CoinGecko API endpoints according to the official Swagger documentation. The endpoints are organized into logical categories:

##### Simple Endpoints
- `/api/simple/price`: Get current prices with customizable options
- `/api/simple/token_price/:id`: Get token prices by contract addresses
- `/api/simple/supported_vs_currencies`: Get supported currency list

##### Coins Endpoints
- `/api/coins/list`: Get all supported coins
- `/api/coins/markets`: Get market data with sorting and filtering
- `/api/coins/:coinId`: Get detailed coin information
- `/api/coins/:coinId/tickers`: Get trading data from exchanges
- `/api/coins/:coinId/history`: Get historical data for specific dates
- `/api/coins/:coinId/market_chart`: Get time-series market data
- `/api/coins/:coinId/market_chart/range`: Get time-series data for custom ranges
- `/api/coins/:coinId/ohlc`: Get candlestick (OHLC) data

##### Contract Endpoints
- Support for contract-based queries across various blockchain platforms
- Market chart data for specific token contracts

##### Additional Categories
- Asset Platforms: Blockchain network information
- Categories: Coin categorization and market data
- Exchanges: Exchange information, tickers, and volume data
- Derivatives: Futures and options market data
- NFTs: Non-fungible token market data (beta)
- Exchange Rates: Currency conversion rates
- Search: Unified search across coins and exchanges
- Global: Market-wide statistics and metrics
- Companies: Corporate treasury holdings data (beta)

## API Limitations

The CoinGecko API has rate limits:
- 10-30 calls/minute for free API tier
- Auto-retry is enabled, but implementing proper caching is recommended for production

## Parameter Handling

- Required parameters are validated with appropriate error responses
- Optional parameters are properly defaulted or excluded as needed
- Parameter types are converted as required (e.g., string to array, string to boolean)
- Complex parameter handling for arrays, comma-separated values, and special formats

## Error Handling Strategy

- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Contextual error messages based on the endpoint and operation
- HTTP status codes aligned with error types:
  * 400: Bad Request (missing or invalid parameters)
  * 500: Internal Server Error (API or server failure)
- Detailed error logging for server-side debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Response caching to reduce API calls
2. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. More detailed error handling
4. Additional endpoints for market data

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement Redis or in-memory caching
- Add compression for responses
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Implement request batching for multiple coin queries

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Add request logging for API usage analysis
- Implement health checks for the API client
- Set up monitoring for rate limit approach warnings
- Create dashboard for API performance metrics
